Hermes: The Financial Teleporter
Hermes is where local money meets the global blockchain. We make it possible for anyone in Uganda (and beyond) to move seamlessly between mobile money and Ethereum, without needing technical know-how or heavy banking infrastructure.

Instant Minting & Redemption
Mint UGDX, our tokenized Ugandan shilling, directly from mobile money. Withdraw it back at any time. One tap, zero friction.

Peer-to-Peer Freedom
Send money instantly to friends, family, or businesses — across borders, networks, and wallets. No delays. No intermediaries.

Utility & Merchant Payments
Pay bills, shop online, and settle with local merchants using UGDX or stablecoins. Hermes is not just finance; it’s everyday life, teleported.

Global Access
Whether you’re funding your wallet from Airtel/MTN, or using an international card via partners like Lemon Squeezy, Hermes gives you options.

Future-Proof
From meta-transactions (gasless UX) to virtual cards that let you choose which token is “live” for online spending, Hermes is building the bleeding edge of money.

FAQ

1. What is UGDX?
UGDX is a digital representation of the Ugandan shilling, minted and burned 1:1 against mobile money deposits. It’s your bridge to the Ethereum blockchain.

2. How is Hermes different from other platforms like Yellow Card or Airtel Money?

Yellow Card doesn’t support P2P transfers. Hermes does.

Airtel is closed-loop. Hermes is open, borderless, and interoperable.

We don’t just let you buy crypto; we let you live with it — pay bills, shop, and transact.

3. What are meta-transactions?
They’re transactions where Hermes pays your gas fees in the background. This means you don’t need to understand wallets, gas, or blockchain — just your phone number and balance.

4. Can I recover my account if I lose my phone?
Yes. Hermes supports aggressive recovery linked to your phone number and secure verification. If you’ve ever used mobile money or USSD, you’ll feel right at home.

5. Do I need a bank account to use Hermes?
No. Hermes is built around mobile-first economies. All you need is a phone number and mobile money access.
